### [Polars Documentation](https://www.pola.rs)

## Overview

This repo has been created using my week 1 mini project as the template which has all the necessary steps to automate the process and I will be using that repo for my future projects as well. The current repo is for creating Polar Descriptive Statistics Script using DevOps principles.


## Code Description

1. polar_stats.py - This python file contains 3 function to calculate mean, median, mode and standard deviation
2. test_stats.py - This python file is reading World University Ranking.csv and testing the four functions in stats_descriptive.py and asserts the true value
3. Generated summary report.md - This is markdown file containing the output. The function create_summary is present in polar_stats.py file which creates this markdown file when we run 'make test' command
4. test_graphs.py - This file contains analysis between count of top universities vs there mean industry income score based on the location. When we run the 'make test' command, the folder named output_graph is created with the graph as shown below.

   The output of the visualization code is  :

### Action include the general CI/CD process in yml file, which automatically generate the graph and markdown

## CI/CD Automation files

1. requirements.txt - Contains all the required python packages
2. Makfefile - Using make to automate different parts of developing a Python project, like -
   
       1. running tests
       2. cleaning builds
       3. installing dependencies
   
   Integrating it into my routine, so can save time and avoid errors.
   
5. .github/workflows - This directory in a Python project (or any GitHub repository) is used for creating and storing GitHub Actions workflows. GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery                           (CI/CD) platform provided by GitHub. The workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch. It sets up :
   
       1. Python environment
       2. Installs project dependencies
       3. Install packages
       4. Linitng
       5. Runs tests
       6. Format
